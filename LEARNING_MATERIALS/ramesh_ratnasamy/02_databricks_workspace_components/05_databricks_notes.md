# Databricks Notebooks: Complete Guide

## Introduction to Databricks Notebooks

Welcome back. In this lesson we're going to look at Databricks notebooks.

### What is a Databricks Notebook?

Databricks offers a **Jupyter-style notebook environment** with additional features to streamline development.

**Definition:**
A notebook is a **collection of cells** that execute commands on a Databricks cluster.

Now that we've created our compute/cluster, let's explore working with notebooks in the Databricks workspace.

## Prerequisite: Starting Your Cluster

Before creating a notebook, ensure your cluster is up and running.

### Steps to Start a Terminated Cluster:

1. Navigate to the **Compute** section
2. Check cluster status (may be terminated from previous session)
3. Click the **Play button** to start the cluster
4. **Confirm** you want to start the cluster

**Note**: You can create notebooks while the cluster is starting.

## Workspace Organization

### Understanding the Workspace Structure

Notebooks exist under the **Workspace** section, which contains:

#### 1. Users Folder
- Contains a folder for each user with workspace access
- Personal workspace for individual users
- Example: `cloudboxacademy@gmail.com`

#### 2. Shared Folder
- Used to share resources and notebooks amongst workspace users
- Collaborative workspace

#### 3. Repos Folder
- Ignore for now (covered later in the course)

---

## Creating a Folder Structure

### Best Practice: Organize Your Notebooks

Before creating notebooks, set up a logical folder structure:

**Example Folder Hierarchy:**
```
Users/
  └── cloudboxacademy@gmail.com/
      └── db-course/
          └── db01-databricks-lakehouse-platform/
```

### How to Create Folders:

1. Navigate to your user folder
2. Right-click and select **"Create Folder"**
3. Name your folder (e.g., "db-course")
4. Create subfolders as needed (e.g., "db01-databricks-lakehouse-platform")

---

## Creating a Notebook

### Two Methods to Create Notebooks:

#### Method 1: Right-Click Menu
- Right-click on the folder
- Select **"Create Notebook"**

#### Method 2: Create Button
- Click the **"Create"** button (top right)
- Navigate to **"Notebook"**

### Notebook Configuration:

**Naming:**
- Databricks assigns a default name
- Provide a meaningful name
- **Example**: "01.notebook_introduction"

**Default Language:**
- Choose the default language for the notebook
- Options: Python, SQL, Scala, R
- **For this demo**: Python

**Important Note:**
The default language applies to all commands in the notebook unless overridden in individual cells.

---

## Attaching Notebook to Cluster

### Required Step:

To execute commands, the notebook **must be attached to a cluster**.

### How to Attach:

1. Click **"Connect"**
2. Select your cluster (e.g., "course-cluster")
3. Wait for connection to establish

## Working with Code Cells

### Executing Cells

#### Sample Python Command:

```python
print("Hello")
```

#### Multiple Ways to Execute:

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Play Button** | Click the play button on the cell |
| **Shift + Enter** | Execute cell and move to next cell |
| **Run Menu** | Go to Run → Run Selected Cell |
| **Run All** | Execute entire notebook |

#### Keyboard Shortcuts:

**To view all shortcuts:**
1. Go to **Help** menu
2. Click **"Keyboard Shortcuts"**
3. View complete list of available commands

### Executing Partial Code

**Select and Run Specific Lines:**

1. Select the line(s) you want to execute
2. Use **Control + Shift + Enter**
3. Or click **"Run Selected Text"**

**Example:**
```python
print("Hello")
print("World")  # Select only this line to execute it alone
```

### Running Multiple Cells

**Run Entire Notebook:**
- Click the **"Run All"** button at the top
- All cells execute sequentially

---

## Creating Additional Cells

### How to Add Cells:

1. **Hover** the mouse between cells
2. Two options appear:
   - **Code Cell**: For executable code
   - **Text Cell**: For documentation (Markdown)

---

## Working with Text Cells (Documentation)

### Text Cell Basics

**Key Identifier:**
- Text cells start with `%md` (Markdown magic command)
- This is the only difference between text and code cells
- Removing `%md` converts it to a code cell

### Markdown Formatting

#### Creating Headers:

**Using Hash Characters:**
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

**Using Menu Options:**
- Recently introduced toolbar
- Click header button to insert
- Select header level (H1, H2, H3, etc.)

#### Creating Bullet Points:

**Manual Method:**
```markdown
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
```

**Menu Method:**
- Click bullet point button in toolbar
- Adds hyphen and space automatically

**Example Output:**
```markdown
%md
## Notebook Introduction

This notebook demonstrates basic operations.

- First bullet point
- Second bullet point
```

**Tip**: Remember to add line breaks (`Enter`) between elements for proper formatting.

---

## Multi-Language Support

### Default vs. Cell-Specific Languages

**Default Language:**
- Set when creating the notebook (e.g., Python)
- Applies to all cells unless overridden

### Magic Commands

**Purpose:**
Magic commands allow you to switch languages for specific cells.

### Using Magic Commands

#### Method 1: Dropdown Menu
1. Click the language dropdown in a cell
2. Select desired language (SQL, Scala, R, etc.)
3. Magic command is automatically added

#### Method 2: Manual Entry
Simply type the magic command at the beginning of the cell:

```sql
%sql
SELECT "Hello from SQL" as greeting
```

### Available Magic Commands:

| Magic Command | Language |
|--------------|----------|
| `%python` | Python |
| `%sql` | SQL |
| `%scala` | Scala |
| `%r` | R |
| `%md` | Markdown |

### Example: Mixed Language Notebook

```python
# Cell 1 - Python (default)
print("Hello from Python")
```

```sql
# Cell 2 - SQL
%sql
SELECT "Hello from SQL" as greeting
```

```python
# Cell 3 - Back to Python
print("Back to Python")
```

**Benefits:**
- Mix Python, SQL, Scala, and R in one notebook
- All commands execute seamlessly
- "That's the beauty of Databricks notebooks!"
