### Questions

**Project & Data Loading:**
- Tell me about your recent project?
- How are you pushing data from s3 to rds PostgreSQL?
- Anything additional that you need to do for that to just make sure that the load is spark is going to generate and postgres not hampering other things?
- Did you try the S3 utility that AWS provide in the RDS, which allows you to directly import the data from S3 into postgradable.

**Scenario: Customer sales data**

Schema: `c_id, c_name, c_state, c_city, c_membership, month, year, total_sales`

- Write a spark sql query customer with max in their state

6. All the jobs are completed, expect on single task is still running in a job, what could be the possible root cause (Ans: due to data skewness)
7. As part of the migration project, we need to create a dynamic data processing framework that can handle various data sources and processing requirements. Our customers have different data processing needs, and we want to provide a flexible solution that can adapt to their changing requirements.

    Your task is to design and implement a Python class that can dynamically generate data processing pipelines based on user-defined configurations.

    **Requirements:**
    1. Create a `PipelineConfig` class that represents a user-defined configuration for a data processing pipeline. The configuration should include the data source type (CSV, JSON), processing steps (e.g., data cleansing, feature engineering), and any additional parameters required for each step.
    2. Implement a `PipelineFactory` class that takes a `PipelineConfig` object as input and generates a corresponding data processing pipeline. The pipeline should be composed of `DataSource` and `DataProcessor` objects, which are instantiated based on the configuration.
    3. Design a `PipelineExecutor` class that takes a generated pipeline and executes it, returning the processed data.
    4. Provide an example usage of the `PipelineFactory` and `PipelineExecutor` classes, demonstrating how to create a pipeline configuration, generate a pipeline, and execute it.

    **Constraints:**
    - Use PySpark's `SparkSession` to create a Spark context for data processing.
    - Ensure that the `PipelineFactory` class can handle different data source types and processing steps.
    - Consider using Databricks' `dbutils` module to interact with the Databricks environment (e.g., for file storage).

## Interview 9

### Questions

1. Project discussion in depth

2. **Python:** The question was more on to do in such a way that it gives most optimized results.

    **Question:** Given two strings, `str1` and `str2`, create a new string, `final_output`, where each character from `str1` is replaced by a corresponding character from `str2`.

    The mapping should follow these rules:
    - Each character from `str1` is mapped to the character from `str2` at the same index, but if the character of str1 is already mapped to char of str2, we will not change the mapping.

    **Example:**
    - Input:
        - `str1 = 'hljljq'`
        - `str2 = 'abcdef'`

    Mapping would look like: `{'h': 'a', 'l': 'b', 'j': 'c', 'q': 'f'}`

    - Output:
        - `final_output = 'abcbcf'`

    Thus, the final string combines these replacements to produce `'abcbcf'`.

3. Data warehouse
    - a. Data warehousing strategies
    - b. Difference between Slowly changing dimensions

4. SQL
    - a. There are multiple records for each id in a table, the column names are id, date. We need the latest record for every id.
    - b. Difference between rank(), row_number(), dense_rank().
    - c. Table name: event (all employee events will be present here) — Use Lead, Lag

        Input:
        ```
        123, 2023-01-01, 'Hire'
        456, 2023-02-01, 'Hire'
        123, 2023-12-31, 'Termination'
        456, 2024-01-31, 'Termination'
        123, 2024-05-01, 'Hire'
        ```

        Output:
        ```
        123, 2023-01-01, 2023-12-31
        456, 2023-02-01, 2024-01-31
        123, 2024-05-01, NULL
        ```

5. Python program to return a list of indices from the given list where the sum of the elements at those indices is equal to the target.
    - Input: `list = [1, 5, 3, 6]`, `target = 8`
    - Output: `[1, 2] # 5 + 3 = 8`, so the index of 5 is 1 and the index of 3 is 2.

6. **SQL:** Get a column "isProficient" and add 1 if sum of the skills from below table > 3 else add 0

    ```
    name | skills
    -----------------
    John | {"s0": "0.0", "s1": "1.0", "s2": "0.0", "s3": "1.0"}
    Mary | {"s0": "1.0", "s1": "1.0", "s2": "1.0", "s3": "1.0"}
    Alex | {"s0": "1.0", "s1": "0.0", "s2": "0.0", "s3": "1.0"}
    ```

## Interview 21 — Interviewer: Santoshkumar Lakkanagaon

### Project Questions

- What are the tools and technologies you have used?
- Explain the different dimensional modeling schemas you've worked with and how you decide which one to use.
- Discuss any challenges faced and how you overcame them.
- Describe your approach to designing efficient data warehouses using dimensional modeling for large datasets and complex reporting requirements, with an example of optimizing models for better performance.
- Have you used Kimball or Inmon approaches for data warehouse design? If so, explain the differences and how you choose between them.

### 1 SQL Question

Atlassian wants to measure website engagement over several days. Given two tables, 'visits' and 'visitors', with columns for visit date, visitor ID, number of pages viewed, and visitor name.

- Write a query to find the visitor who made the most visits each day.
- If there's a tie, select the visitor whose username is alphabetically first.

### 1 Python Question

You are given a collection of intervals, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`. Your task is to merge overlapping intervals and return a list of merged intervals. Two intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` are considered overlapping if `b >= c` (at least one common point).

For example: Input: `[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]` Output: `[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]` Explanation: `[1, 3]` and `[2, 6]` overlap, so merge them into `[1, 6]`.

### SQL 1: Find Second Degree Friends — Friends of Friends

```sql
create table friends (
    src_id integer,
    dest_id integer,
    activity_type varchar,
    activity_time date
);

insert into friends values(1,2,'add','2024-01-01');
insert into friends values(1,3,'remove','2024-01-01');
insert into friends values(2,1,'add','2024-01-01');
insert into friends values(2,4,'add','2024-01-01');
insert into friends values(4,2,'add','2024-01-01');
insert into friends values(4,3,'add','2024-01-01');

with cte as (
    select *,
        row_number() over(partition by src_id, dest_id order by activity_time desc) as rn
    from friends
    where activity_type='add'
)
select distinct
    case
        when a.src_id < b.dest_id then a.src_id else b.dest_id
    end as src_id,
    case
        when a.src_id > b.dest_id then a.src_id else b.dest_id
    end as dest_id
from cte a
inner join cte b
on a.dest_id = b.src_id
where a.rn = 1 and b.rn = 1
and a.src_id != b.dest_id
order by src_id;
```

Expected output:
```
1, 4
2, 3
```

SELECT p.product_name, coalesce(avg(s.sale_amt), 0)
from Sales s
left join product p on s.product_id = p.product_id
where year(sale_date) = '2024'
group by p.product_name
```

**2. Write a SQL query to retrieve the names of the salespersons who sold both Jira and Confluence in Jan 2024.**

    s.salesperson_name,
    p.product_name
from sales s
join product p
    on s.product_id = p.product_id
join salesperson sp
    on s.salesperson_id = sp.salesperson_id
where date_trunc('month', s.sale_date) = '2024-01-01'
    and p.product_name in ('JIRA', 'Confluence')
group by p.product_name, s.salesperson_name
having count(distinct p.product_name) = 2
```

**3. Print the salesperson_name, manager_name**

Expected output:

num2 = int(input())
print("The sum is", addNumbers(num1, num2))
```

**Q2:** Given a list, print the elements in the odd position.
- Input: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `[1, 3, 5]`

```python
res = []
for i in range(0, len(Input)):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        res.append(Input[i])
return res
```

**Q3:** Given a list, print a running cumulative sum of its items.
- Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Output: `[1, 3, 6]`

```python
res = []
t_sum = 0
for i in range(0, len(Input)):
    t_sum += Input[i]
    res.append(t_sum)
return res
```

**Q4:** Given a string, write a python function to calculate the average length of the words in the string.
- Input: `"Hello World"`
- Output: 5

```python
l = Input.split(" ")  # ["Hello","World"]
n = len(l)

t_sum = 0
for i in range(0, n):
    t_sum += len(l[i])
return t_sum / n
```

**Q5:** Find the min and max element from the list and remove these element from the final results.
- Input: `[10, 57, 17, 90, 100]`
- Output: `[57, 17, 90]`

**Q6:** Remove the element which exceeds the threshold point
- Input: `[1, 5, 6, 2, 9, 10]`, threshold = 5
- Output: `[1, 5, 2]`
