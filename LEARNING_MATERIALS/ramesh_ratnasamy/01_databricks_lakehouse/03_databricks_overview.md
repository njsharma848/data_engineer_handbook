## Apache Spark: The Foundation

### What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a **fast, unified analytical engine** designed for big data processing and machine learning.

**History:**
- Originally developed at UC Berkeley in 2009
- Open-sourced in 2010
- Became an Apache Software Foundation project in 2013
- Has seen significant adoption since

**Industry Usage:**

Companies like Yahoo, eBay, and Netflix use Spark for large-scale data processing, handling **petabytes of data** on clusters with **thousands of nodes**.

On AWS, Databricks is deployed directly into the customer's AWS account. Databricks clusters run as EC2 instances within your VPC, and data resides in your own S3 buckets.

### Key AWS Integration Points

- **IAM** roles for authentication and access control
- **S3** for data storage (the primary data plane storage)
- **VPC** peering for secure network connectivity between the control plane and data plane
- **AWS KMS** for encryption key management
- **CloudWatch** for monitoring Databricks workloads and analyzing performance
- **AWS CodePipeline** for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)
- Separate Databricks account billing (independent from the AWS bill)

+=====================================================================+
```

### Why This Matters

- **Data sovereignty**: Customer data remains in the customer's cloud account
- **Security**: Only metadata (not data) crosses the boundary to Databricks
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements where data must stay in specific regions
- **Cost**: Compute costs appear on the customer's cloud bill (except for Databricks licensing)

## KEY INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

### Q1: What is Databricks, and how does it relate to Apache Spark?
**A:** Databricks is a unified data analytics platform built on top of Apache Spark, founded by the creators of Spark. While Spark is the open-source distributed compute engine at the core, Databricks adds essential management layers including simplified cluster management, an integrated notebook IDE, optimized runtimes (up to 5x faster than vanilla Spark), the Photon query engine, Delta Lake for ACID transactions, Unity Catalog for governance, and workflow orchestration. On AWS, Databricks deploys into the customer's AWS account using EC2 instances, S3 for storage, IAM for access control, and VPC peering for secure connectivity.

### Q2: What is the difference between the Control Plane and the Data Plane in Databricks?
**A:** The Control Plane is managed by Databricks and includes the web UI, REST APIs, notebook service, cluster manager, job scheduler, and Unity Catalog metadata. The Data Plane runs in the customer's own cloud subscription and includes the actual compute clusters (VMs) and cloud object storage where data resides. This separation ensures that customer data never leaves their cloud account -- only metadata and commands travel to the control plane -- which is critical for security and compliance.

### Q3: What are the different cluster types in Databricks, and when would you use each?
**A:** Databricks offers four main compute options: (1) All-Purpose Clusters for interactive development and exploration, shared among users, manually started and stopped; (2) Job Clusters for automated production jobs, created on-demand and terminated after the job completes, which is more cost-effective; (3) SQL Warehouses for SQL analytics, BI tool queries, and dashboards with built-in autoscaling; (4) Serverless compute for instant startup with no cluster management, available for notebooks, jobs, and SQL warehouses with pay-per-use pricing.

### Q4: How does Databricks integrate with AWS?
**A:** On AWS, Databricks integrates with native services: S3 for storage, IAM for identity and access management, VPC peering for secure networking, KMS for encryption key management, CloudWatch for monitoring, and CodePipeline for CI/CD. Databricks is deployed as a third-party integration into the customer's AWS account. Clusters run as EC2 instances in the customer's VPC, and data stays in the customer's S3 buckets. Billing is separate -- Databricks charges appear on a separate Databricks bill, not on the AWS bill.

### Q5: What is the Photon query engine and when should you use it?
**A:** Photon is a high-performance vectorized query engine written in C++ that runs natively within the Databricks runtime. It provides up to 8x performance improvement over the standard Databricks runtime for SQL and DataFrame operations. You should enable Photon for SQL-heavy workloads, BI dashboard queries, and large-scale ETL jobs that involve scanning, filtering, and aggregating large datasets. Photon is compatible with the Spark API so no code changes are needed -- you simply select a Photon-enabled runtime when creating a cluster.

### Q6: What is Delta Live Tables (DLT) and how does it differ from regular Spark jobs?
**A:** Delta Live Tables is a declarative ETL framework where you define WHAT your pipeline should produce (target tables and their transformations) rather than HOW to execute it. DLT automatically manages task orchestration, error handling, data quality enforcement (via Expectations), and incremental processing. In contrast, regular Spark jobs require you to manually handle execution order, error recovery, state management, and checkpoint logic. DLT is purpose-built for implementing Medallion Architecture pipelines with built-in monitoring and quality metrics.

### Q7: What Databricks Runtime version should you use for production workloads?
**A:** For production workloads, you should always use a Long Term Support (LTS) runtime version, which is supported for 2+ years with bug fixes and security patches. Choose the standard Databricks Runtime for general data engineering, the ML Runtime for machine learning workloads (it includes pre-installed ML libraries), or the Photon-enabled runtime for SQL-heavy workloads. Avoid non-LTS versions in production as they have shorter support windows and may introduce breaking changes.

### Q8: How does Databricks compare to Snowflake for data engineering?
**A:** Databricks excels at data engineering with native Apache Spark for complex ETL, built-in streaming support via Structured Streaming, strong ML capabilities through MLflow and ML runtimes, and open-source foundations (Delta Lake, Spark, MLflow). Snowflake excels at SQL-based analytics with near-zero administration, simpler pricing, and easier onboarding for SQL-focused teams. Key differences: Databricks uses open formats (Delta/Parquet) while Snowflake uses proprietary storage; Databricks offers richer programmatic support (Python, Scala, R) while Snowflake centers on SQL; Databricks provides notebook-based development while Snowflake provides a SQL worksheet interface.
